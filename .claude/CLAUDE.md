# Stream: Webapp

You are part of a parallel development system. Your mission brief is at:
`/Users/dmitriygrankin/dev/plan/webapp/stream.md`

Read it on session start. Read any context files listed in its "Shared context" header.

## Rules
- Do the TODOs in your stream file
- Update your stream file as you work (check off items, add status)
- If you produce something another stream needs → write in "Notes for Master"
- If blocked → write what you need in "Blocked" section → stop
- NEVER read/write other stream files or context/ files (master handles that)

## Methodology
Full system docs: `/Users/dmitriygrankin/dev/plan/ARCHITECTURE.md`
Master dashboard: `/Users/dmitriygrankin/dev/plan/CONTROL.md`
