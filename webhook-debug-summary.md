# Webhook Integration Debug Summary

## ✅ What's Working
- **Billing service is receiving live Stripe webhooks** from production
- **Some webhooks succeed (200 OK)** - signature validation works
- **Our test webhooks work perfectly** - local signature generation is correct
- **Service integration is working** - Admin API updates succeed

## ❌ What's Failing
- **Some live webhooks return 400 Bad Request** - signature validation fails
- **Pattern observed**: Same timestamp, same payload, different signatures from different IPs

## 🔍 Debug Information Added
Enhanced webhook signature validation with detailed logging:
- ✅ Timestamp extraction
- ✅ Signature comparison details  
- ✅ Expected vs received signature logging
- ✅ Error details for failed validations

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Observed Pattern:
```
✅ IP: 3.18.12.63   - t=1754830925,v1=47a2d0cb... → 400 Bad Request
✅ IP: 52.15.183.38 - t=1754830925,v1=a12da21e... → 200 OK
```

**Same timestamp, different signatures** = Multiple webhook endpoints or signature issues

## 🔧 Potential Solutions

### 1. Check Stripe Dashboard
- Verify only **one webhook endpoint** configured for `deg_gateway.dev.vexa.ai:19000`
- Check for duplicate endpoints or multiple environments

### 2. Webhook Secret Verification
- Confirm webhook secret matches between Stripe Dashboard and `.env` file
- Verify secret hasn't been rotated recently

### 3. Stripe Retry Behavior  
- Stripe retries failed webhooks up to 3 times
- Different servers may generate different signatures
- Consider implementing **idempotency** handling

## 📊 Current Status
- **Production system is working** - successful webhooks are processing
- **Integration tests pass** - billing ↔ admin-api flow works
- **Only partial webhook failures** - not blocking critical functionality

## 🎬 Next Steps
1. Wait for next live webhook to see debug output
2. Check Stripe Dashboard for multiple endpoints
3. Verify webhook secret configuration
4. Consider implementing webhook idempotency if needed
